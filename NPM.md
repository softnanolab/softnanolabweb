# Node Package Manager

NPM is a way to install Javascript libraries on your system... like `pip` for python.

First you have to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```bash sudo apt install nodejs ```

Then you can install using:

```bash sudo apt install npm ```

You can use the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/) to find packages, and instructions on how to install them.

## What is `package.json`?

It holds all your application's information, importantly it's dependencies!

## Install, remove, update & list packages

`npm i <package_name>`
